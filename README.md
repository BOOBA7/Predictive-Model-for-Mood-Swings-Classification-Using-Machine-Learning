# Predictive-Model-for-Mood-Swings-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
This project was developed as part of my Data Science Bootcamp at GoMyCode Morocco, under the mentorship of Yannis Pandis. The main objective was to build a robust machine learning model to predict mood swings based on a comprehensive dataset containing various clinical and demographic features.

The project involved several key steps:

Data exploration and preprocessing, including handling categorical variables and addressing potential biases.

Feature analysis, notably through the use of Cramér’s V matrix to understand associations between categorical variables and identify redundancies.

Model development and evaluation, comparing multiple classifiers such as Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, HistGradientBoosting, and XGBoost, with a focus on performance metrics and fairness analysis.

Fairness assessment using tools like Aequitas to ensure the model does not exhibit bias towards sensitive groups, particularly gender.

Interpretation and documentation of results, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of the model, including constraints related to data structure (e.g., absence of patient identifiers).

This project not only demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation but also emphasizes ethical considerations in AI through fairness analysis. It serves as a solid foundation for applying data science techniques to real-world health data challenges.

I am excited to share this work with my mentor, Yannis Pandis, for pedagogical feedback and continuous learning.
