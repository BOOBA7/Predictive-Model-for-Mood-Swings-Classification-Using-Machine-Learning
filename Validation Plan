Validation Plan
1. Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

Use stratified sampling to maintain the distribution of the target classes across splits.

2. Performance Metrics
Evaluate the model using multiple metrics suited for multi-class classification:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score per class

Confusion matrix analysis to understand misclassifications

Additionally, compute metrics related to fairness (e.g., True Negative Rate, False Positive Rate) across sensitive groups such as gender.

3. Cross-Validation
Perform k-fold cross-validation on the training set to assess model stability and robustness.

Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

4. Fairness Assessment
Use fairness auditing tools (e.g., Aequitas) to detect and quantify potential biases across sensitive attributes.

Compare performance metrics between groups (e.g., Male vs Female) to ensure equitable treatment.

5. Statistical Significance Testing
Apply significance tests to verify whether observed differences in performance or fairness metrics are statistically meaningful.

6. Model Interpretability
Analyze feature importance and model explanations to understand decision drivers.

Validate that the modelâ€™s behavior aligns with domain knowledge and ethical considerations.

7. Limitations and Monitoring
Document known limitations, such as the absence of patient identifiers and potential data dependencies.

Plan for ongoing monitoring of model performance and fairness once deployed.
