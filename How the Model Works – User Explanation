How the Model Works – User Explanation
Our model is designed to predict mood swings based on information collected during medical consultations. Here is how it works in simple terms:

Input Data:
The model takes as input various pieces of information about the patient’s condition and background, such as clinical symptoms, demographic details, and responses collected during consultations.

Data Processing:
Before making predictions, the model processes this data to understand the relationships between different factors. It looks for patterns and connections that are not always obvious.

Prediction:
Using these patterns, the model predicts the likelihood that a patient is experiencing a certain level of mood swings, classified into three categories (for example: low, medium, high).

Output:
The model outputs a classification that helps healthcare professionals better understand the patient’s mental state and make informed decisions.

Fairness and Accuracy:
Special care was taken to ensure the model treats all patients fairly, regardless of gender or other sensitive factors. The model was tested extensively to confirm its accuracy and fairness.

This approach allows the model to assist clinicians by providing an additional, data-driven perspective on mood swings, supporting better diagnosis and treatment planning.
